add all lines from 1,2,3,etc into one file using the same format

if the format is:
receivetime-<receiver>$-$<sender>: sendtime&&&<message>
convert it into:
receivetime sendtime message


Once we have a file containing lines in the above format, write 2 functions:

latency() - returns the average value of receivetime-sendtime for a message (do receivetime - sendtime for each message and calculate avg of that)

throughput(w) - order all sendtimes and put in a new file:
                        suppose you have sendfile like:
                                        20
                                        23
                                        23.5
                                        24
                                        25
                        calculate avg number of sendtimes in the window (x,x+w) for all x.
                        for ex, take x = 20 (bcs its the min value) and increment by a small value like 0.1 or something
                        now, find the number of send times lying between x and x+w (inclusive) and store that for all x until x + w becomes 25(the last value)
                        Now, take avg of all these values and print it calling it INPUTTHROUGHPUT

                do the same for receivetimes and call it OUTPUTTHROUGHPUT
